# cloud-itonami-isco-6121

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 6121**: Livestock and Dairy Producers.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for an independent livestock and dairy producer: a herd-monitoring robot performs health sensing and feed dispensing under a governor-gated actor, so the operator keeps their own herd and health records instead of renting a closed livestock-management SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a herd-monitoring robot performs health sensing, feed dispensing and milking-support tasks under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Livestock Dairy Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
administering veterinary medication, or operating near large livestock) require human sign-off.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.

## Core Contract

```text
herd management plan + feed schedule + health protocol
        |
        v
Livestock Advisor -> Livestock Dairy Governor -> feed/monitor-health, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.

                                           +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)

```

- `src/livestock_dairy/store.cljk` — `Store` protocol +
  `MemStore`: registered herds, committed records, an append-only
  audit ledger.
- `src/livestock_dairy/advisor.cljk` — `Advisor` protocol;
  `mock-advisor` (deterministic, default) proposes a feed or
  monitor-health operation from a request; `llm-advisor` wraps a
  `langchain.model/ChatModel` — either way the advisor only ever
  produces a `:propose`-effect proposal, never a committed record, and
  LLM parse failures always yield `confidence 0.0` (forces escalation,
  never fabricated confidence).
- `src/livestock_dairy/governor.cljk` —
  `LivestockDairyGovernor/check`: a pure function, wired as its own
  `:govern` node. Hard invariants (unregistered herd, a proposal
  whose `:effect` isn't `:propose`) always route to `:hold`. Escalation
  invariants (`:administer-veterinary-medication`,
  `:operate-near-large-livestock`, or low advisor confidence) always
  route to `:request-approval` — an `interrupt-before` node that the
  graph checkpoints and only resumes on explicit human approval
  (`actor/approve!`), matching the README's robotics-premise statement
  that administering veterinary medication, or operating near large
  livestock, always require human sign-off.
- `src/livestock_dairy/actor.cljk` — `build-graph`, `run-request!`,
  `approve!`: the `langgraph.graph/state-graph` wiring itself.
